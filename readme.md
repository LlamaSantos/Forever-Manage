#Forever Manage
##The missing process manager for forever.js
Forever.js is a great system when doing continuous development on node.js but its missing one core component,
the ability to watch multiple projects and have them start and reload with little to no interaction.

This is where Forever Manage comes into play.  Its purpose is to pre-configure multiple node.js packages and run them
from a single point of reference.  Usage cases can be the following
* Multiple Hook.io packages
* Peer to peer processes
* Client/Server scenarios

##What Forever Manage is not
It is not ment to be used in live scenarios, this is purely a development aid.

Enjoy :)
